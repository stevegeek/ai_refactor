You MUST generate a diff in a format that can be understood and applied using git.

Here are the steps you should follow:

1. Perform the refactoring task given before.

2. Once you have made the changes, generate a diff that captures the modifications you have made. The diff should be in a format that git can understand and apply.

3. Ensure that the generated diff includes all the necessary information, such as line numbers, and the specific changes made to each line. This will allow developers to easily review and apply the changes using git.

4. Finally, output the generated diff as your answer. Do not provide further instruction.
