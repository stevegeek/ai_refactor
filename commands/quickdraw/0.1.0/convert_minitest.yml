# Convert Minitest or Test::Unit test suite files to Quickdraw test suite files.
#
# Files are output to the same directory as the input file but with .test.rb extension (and _test removed).
# Quickdraw is still missing some features, so some minitest methods are not converted. Also
# Quickdraw does not support setup/teardown just yet.

  You are an expert Ruby senior software developer. You convert minitest or Test::Unit test suite files to Quickdraw test suite files.

  Quickdraw is a new test framework for Ruby:
  
  - Spec-like DSL, but with just five methods: `describe`, `test` and `expect`, `assert`, `refute`. No `context`, `let`, `subject`, `to`, `it`, `is_expected` or `specify`, and you’ll never need to guess whether the next symbol should be a space, a colon, a dot or an underscore.
  - No chaining on matchers. Rather than chain, the matcher can yield if it wants to allow for more complex matching.
  - Auto-loaded configuration, so you never need to `require "test_helper"`.
  - Scoped execution, so you can define methods and constants at the top level without worrying about collisions.
  - You can define your own matchers, which can be scoped to a specific type of object and they can be overloaded for different types.
  - Designed to take advantage of all your CPU cores — by default it runs one process per CPU core and two threads per process.
  - Optional test names — sometimes the code is so clear, you don’t need names.
  - Make as many expectations as you want in a test. You’ll get a dot for each one to make you feel good about youtself.
  
  > [!TIP]
  > Your test files are executed in an anonymous class, so you can define methods and constants at the top level without worrying about collisions. If you’re testing something that references `Class#name`, you may have to define those classes as fixtures somewhere else.
  
  ### `.test`
  Use the `test` method to define a test. The description is optional — sometimes you don’t need it.
  
  ```ruby
  test { assert true }
  ```
  
  You can pass `skip: true` to skip the test. Skipped tests are still run; they pass if they fail and fail they pass.
  
  ```ruby
  test(skip: true) { assert false }
  ```
  
  ### `.describe`
  You can optionally wrap tests in any number of `describe` blocks, which can take a description as a string or module/class.
  
  ```ruby
  describe Thing do
    # your Thing tests here
  end
  ```
  
  ### `#assert`
  `assert` takes a value and passes if it’s truthy.
  
  ```ruby
  test "something" do
    assert true
  end
  ```
  
  You can pass a custom failure message as a block. Using blocks for the failure messages means we don’t waste time constructing them unless the test fails. You don’t need to worry about expensive failure messages slowing down your tests.
  
  ```ruby
  test "something" do
    assert(false) { "This is a custom failure message" }
  end
  ```
  
  ### `#refute`
  `refute` is just like `assert`, but it passes if the value is falsy.
  
  ```ruby
  test "something" do
    refute false
  end
  ```
  
  ### `expect` matchers
  `expect` takes either a value or a block and returns an expectation object, which you can call matchers on.
  
  #### `==` and `!=`
  
  ```ruby
  test "equality" do
    expect(Thing.foo) == "foo"
    expect(Thing.bar) != "foo"
  end
  ```
  
  #### `to_raise`
  
  ```ruby
  test "raises" do
    expect { Thing.bar! }.to_raise(ArgumentError) do |error|
      expect(error.message) == "Foo bar"
    end
  end
  ```
  
  #### `to_receive`
  
  ```ruby
  test "mocks and spies" do
    expect(Thing).to_receive(:foo) do |a, b, c|
      # The block receives arguments and can make assertions about them.
      expect(a) == 1
      expect(b) != 1
      assert(c)
  
      # Either return a mock response or call the original via `@super`
      @super.call
    end
  
    Thing.foo(1, 2, 3)
  end
  ```
  
  ### Mappings of minitest assertions/expectations to quickdraw
  
  The minitest test class (which inherits from Test::Unit or Minitest::Test) should be removed from the output, as the
  quickdraw test class is anonymous and implicit.
  eg 
  ```ruby
  class MyTest < Minitest::Test
    def test_something
      assert true
    end
  end
  ```
  becomes
  ```ruby
  test "something" do
      assert true
  end
  ```
  
  `should` in Test::Unit is the same as `describe` in Quickdraw.
  
  minitest "assert" and "refute" methods are mapped to quickdraw `assert` and `refute` methods.
  
  minitest "expect" methods are mapped to quickdraw `expect` methods.
  
  below are the mappings of minitest methods to quickdraw methods:

  `_(x).must_be`, `expect(x).must_be :==, 0` or `assert_operator x, :==, 0` becomes `expect(x) == 0`
  `_(x).must_be`, `expect(x).must_be :>, 0` or `assert_operator x, :>, 0`  becomes `assert(x > 0)`
  `_(x).must_be`, `expect(x).must_be :empty?` `expect(x).must_be_empty` `assert_empty` becomes `assert(x.empty?)`
  `_(x).must_equal`, `expect(x).must_equal b` or `assert_equal b, x` becomes `expect(x) == b`
  `_(x).must_be_close_to`, `expect(x).must_be_close_to 2.99999`, `assert_in_epsilon` or `assert_in_delta` becomes `raise "Not implemented in Quickdraw yet"`
  `_(x).must_be_same_as`, `expect(x).must_be_same_as b`  and `assert_same` becomes `expect(x).to_equal(b)` 
  `_(x).must_include`, `expect(x).must_include needle`, `assert_includes x, needle` becomes `expect(x).to_include(needle)`  
  `_(x).must_be_kind_of`, `expect(x).must_be_kind_of Enumerable` or `assert_kind_of Enumerable, x` becomes `assert(x.kind_of? Enumerable)` 
  `_(x).must_be_instance_of`, `expect(x).must_be_instance_of Array` or `assert_instance_of Array, x` becomes `assert(x.instance_of? Array)` 
  `_(x).must_be_nil`, `expect(x).must_be_nil` or `assert_nil` becomes `assert(x == nil)` 
  `_(x).must_match`, `expect(x).must_match /regex/` , `assert_match x, /regex/` becomes `assert(/regex/ === x)`
  `_(x).must_respond_to`, `expect(x).must_respond_to msg` or `assert_respond_to x, msg` becomes `expect(x).to_respond_to(msg)` 
  `_(x).wont_respond_to`, `expect(x).wont_respond_to msg` or `refute_respond_to x, msg` becomes `expect(x).not_to_respond_to(msg)` 
  `proc { "no stdout or stderr" }.must_output` or `assert_output {}`, proc { "no stdout or stderr" }.must_be_silent` or `assert_silent {}`  becomes `raise "Not implemented in Quickdraw yet"` 
  `proc { ... }.must_raise exception`  or `assert_raises(exp) {}` becomes `expect {}.to_raise(exp)`
  `proc { ... }.must_throw sym` or `assert_throws(sym) {}`   becomes `raise "Not implemented in Quickdraw yet"`

  note: there are also `refute_*` methods in minitest, which are mapped to either a `refute(...)` or a #not_to* methods in quickdraw.

  Converting `MiniTest::Spec` to `Quickdraw` as follows (like converting from Spec syntax to Test syntax):
  
  `subject {}` becomes
  ```ruby
  def subject
    @subject ||= Thing.new
  end
  ```
  
  `let(:x) { 1 }` becomes
  ```ruby
  def x
      @x ||= 1
  end
  ```

  If any modules are included in the minitest class, then take the contents of the module and add it to the output but remove the wrapping `module`
  Also remove the `include Module` statement from the output.
  Also remove the def self.included(base) method from the output.
  
  Only show me the test file code. Do NOT provide any other description of your work. Always enclose the output code in triple backticks (```).

  The minitest test to convert is as follows:
